TODO:

Start custom ELPA server

Submit the packages in starter-kit-elpa.el to ELPA.

Check each of starter-kit-packages periodically to make sure they're
all up to date.

maybe include:
* pcmpl-rake (or put it in another file; it's only 2 functions)
* should yasnippet be included in rinari?

to write/finish:
* mublog
* ri
* submit ruby fixes to flymake

Bug fixes:
get jabber.el to automatically disconnect when suspending/hibernating (via dbus)
ruby-compilation.el should auto-kill the buffer on successful test runs; only leave it open on error/fail
