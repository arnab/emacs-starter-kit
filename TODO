TODO:

Start custom ELPA server
Add bleeding-edge package support to elpa?

look up http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs-en/CommandLogMode

to add to elpa:
* ruby-electric
* ruby-compilation

* color-theme (zenburn + vivid chalk)
* htmlize

* cheat
* gist
* lisppaste
* scpaste
* magit
* yaml (make rinari require it)

* nxhtml (remove bundled deps)
* rinari
* jabber (need to contact maintainers)
* slime
* pg

Check the list of elpa packages periodically to make sure they're all
up to date:
* ruby-mode
* inf-ruby
* idle-highlight
* js2-mode
* css
* ert

maybe include:
* pcmpl-rake (or put it in another file; it's only 2 functions)
* should yasnippet be included in rinari?

to write/finish:
* mublog
* ri
* submit ruby fixes to flymake

Bug fixes:
get jabber.el to automatically disconnect when suspending/hibernating (via dbus)
ruby-compilation.el should auto-kill the buffer on successful test runs; only leave it open on error/fail
