# Emacs Starter Kit

This should provide a saner set of defaults than you get normally with
Emacs. It's intended for beginners, but it should provide a reasonable
working environment for anyone using Emacs.

## Installation

1. Install Emacs
   Use your package manager if you have one.
   Otherwise, Mac users should get it [from Apple](http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/unix_open_source/carbonemacspackage.html).
   Windows users can get it [from GNU](http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/emacs-22.3-bin-i386.zip).
2. Move this directory to ~/.emacs.d
3. Launch Emacs!

## ELPA

Libraries from ELPA (http://tromey.com/elpa) are preferred when
available since dependencies are handled automatically, and the burden
to update them is removed from the user.

## Contributing

If you know your way around Emacs, please try out the starter kit as a
replacement for your regular dotfiles for a while. If there's anything
you just can't live without, add it or let me know so I can add it.

Also: see the file TODO.
